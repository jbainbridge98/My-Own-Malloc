Test case D-

Test case D is my way of showing that free is freeing the actual pointer it is given. The test cases given could have been easily worked around with the myFree function
by having the myFree function just free the first non free block in the data. I did not do this, myFree in this code frees the data at the given pointer, and test case D
highlights this.

Test case E-

Test case E shows that my code handles all the errors that the normal malloc does not. My malloc does not allow you to free an address that is not a pointer, free a pointer
that was not malloced, free a pointer that was already freed, or allow the user to ask for more memory than it can handle. When any of these errors occur my code outputs
detailed errors. I apologize in advance for the many error messages I push out, it is in the name of science.
